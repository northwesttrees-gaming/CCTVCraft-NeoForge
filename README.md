# CCTVCraft for NeoForge
Whether you want to spy on your friend's house on a server or keep an eye on your village, 
CCTVCraft will provide you with the tools to watch whatever you want anywhere you want. 
We have used MCreator to make this complex mod from the ground up. NorthWestTrees Gaming maintains the mod.

### ü¶ä Why NeoForge
MCreator will be migrating their API to NeoForge so I don't have much choice on what API I use. 
This change however allows me to remake the mod from the ground up, 
address issues that people had in the old forge version and make it easier for me to develop the mod for years to come.

### üåü Add-ons
The new version of the mod allows me to make the daunting task of managing its features easier by breaking the mod up into addons. 
This will allow people to pick and choose what features they want to use and also allow me an easier time to update and troubleshoot issues in the modification.  
  
Some planned add-ons are Cameras which add new cameras and monitors, and unique mechanics for them. 
Another thing planned is entity drones which will be harder to implement but will continue where I left off with the work for CCTVCraft for Forge. 
This way people can mix and match Addons while the core allows for the script needed to run the mod.

### üöß Major Changes
CCTVCraft for NeoForge will be way better on performance. 
I have taken a step back and looked at the system I used before and looked into functions and commands which should allow better performance for clients and servers. 
This however comes with its challenges and does take more time to develop the mod.

# üí° Community Feedback
This mod is community-driven, if you have suggestions or want to request a feature don't hesitate to open a feature request. 
I will try to implement it if it's in the scope of the mod.

# üêû Community Testing
Though I do test the mod's basic functionality it's easy for bugs to slip through the cracks. 
If you notice any issues with the mod don't hesitate to report the issue here so I can try to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
